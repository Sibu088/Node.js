          <p>Hello! I'm a software developer with a focus on building full-stack web applications that are clean, functional, and engaging. I specialize in using technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, and Python, and I've worked with frameworks such as Django and Express.</p>
          <p>I enjoy bringing ideas to life through codeâ€”whether it's a dynamic portfolio, an admin dashboard, or a full-featured web app with authentication, databases, and API integrations. I believe in writing clean, maintainable code and continuously learning new tools to enhance my development process.</p>
          <p>I'm currently growing my skills in cloud computing, freelancing, and startup tech to build innovative solutions that solve real-world problems. My mission is to build impactful software and help others through technology.</p>
